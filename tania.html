<div>What is sdlc? <br>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands. 

</div>


</div>


<p>   The initial concept and creation of the SDLC only addressed security activities as a separate and singular task, performed as part of the testing phase. The shortcomings of this after-the-fact approach were the inevitably high number of vulnerabilities or bugs discovered too late in the process, or in certain cases, not discovered at all.  </p>
